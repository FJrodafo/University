## Install

[Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) / [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/)

```shell
# Upgrade
sudo apt-get install ./docker-desktop-<version>-<arch>.deb
```

## Install from a package

If you can't use Docker's `apt` repository to install Docker Engine, you can download the `deb` file for your release and install it manually. You need to download a new file each time you want to upgrade Docker Engine.

1. Go to https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/dists/
2. Select your Debian version in the list.
3. Go to `pool/stable/` and select the applicable architecture (`amd64`, `armhf`, `arm64`, or `s390x`).
4. Download the following deb files for the Docker Engine, CLI, containerd, and Docker Compose packages:
    * `containerd.io_<version>_<arch>.deb`
    * `docker-ce_<version>_<arch>.deb`
    * `docker-ce-cli_<version>_<arch>.deb`
    * `docker-buildx-plugin_<version>_<arch>.deb`
    * `docker-compose-plugin_<version>_<arch>.deb`
5. Install the `.deb` packages. Update the paths in the following example to where you downloaded the Docker packages.
    ```sh
    sudo dpkg -i ./containerd.io_<version>_<arch>.deb \
    ./docker-ce_<version>_<arch>.deb \
    ./docker-ce-cli_<version>_<arch>.deb \
    ./docker-buildx-plugin_<version>_<arch>.deb \
    ./docker-compose-plugin_<version>_<arch>.deb
    ```
    The Docker daemon starts automatically.
6. Verify that the installation is successful by running the `hello-world` image:
    ```sh
    sudo service docker start
    sudo docker run hello-world
    ```
    This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints a confirmation message and exits.

You have now successfully installed and started Docker Engine. To upgrade Docker Engine, download the newer package files and repeat the installation procedure, pointing to the new files.

## Docker Hub

Docker Hub is the world's easiest way to create, manage, and deliver your team's container applications.

Browse over 100,000 container images from software vendors, open-source projects, and the community.

[Build and Ship any Application Anywhere](https://hub.docker.com/)

## Images

To download the latest [Node.js](https://hub.docker.com/_/node) image, we type the following command:

```shell
docker pull node
```

Download a specific version of Node.js, in this case version 18:

```shell
docker pull node:18
```

Sometimes Docker will throw us an error when downloading an image if we are on macOS or Windows, so, to fix it, we have to specify the download platform. In this case we will download the latest version of [MySQL](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql):

```shell
docker pull --platform linux/x86_64 mysql
```

List all images downloaded to our computer:

```shell
docker images
```

Delete a specific image:

```shell
docker image rm node:18
```

## Basic Commands

Before creating a container, we need to have an [image installed](#images). In this case we will download the latest version of [MongoDB](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo):

```shell
docker pull mongo
```

Now that we have our MongoDB image downloaded, we can create our first container:

```shell
docker container create mongo
```

Run the container:

```shell
docker start <container-id>
```

View the data and confirm the execution of the containers:

```shell
docker ps
```

Stop de container:

```shell
docker stop <container-id>
```

Shows all existing containers regardless of whether they are running or not:

```shell
docker ps -a
```

Delete a specific container:

```shell
docker rm <container-id/name>
```

Create a container with a custom name:

```shell
docker create --name <custom-name> mongo
```

Run the container with a custom name:

```shell
docker start <custom-name>
```

We can also stop and remove the container with the custom name:

```shell
docker stop <custom-name>
docker rm <custom-name>
```

Create a container with the ports mapped:

```shell
docker create -p27017:27017 --name <custom-name> mongo
```

Verify if your server ran correctly:

```shell
docker logs <container-id/name>
```

Verify if your server ran correctly with the option to keep listening:

```shell
docker logs --follow <container-id/name>
# Press 'Ctrl + C' to exit
```

We can download an image, create a container, and start it with a single command:

```shell
docker run mongo
```

We could also add an option so that it does not show us the logs:

```shell
docker run -d mongo
```

Finally we could mix all the commands and options for our MongoDB container:

```shell
docker run --name <custom-name> -p27017:27017 -d mongo
```

## Overview of the get started guide

The following guide has been taken from: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/

It is not the complete guide, I have only taken the parts that I considered most important to me.

## Containerize an application

For the rest of this guide, you'll be working with a simple to-do list manager that runs on Node.js. If you are not familiar with Node.js, don't worry. This guide doesn't require any prior experience with JavaScript.

### Prerequisites

- You have installed the latest version of [Docker Desktop](#install).
- You have installed a [Git client](./../Git/README.md).
- You have an IDE or a text editor to edit files. Docker recommends using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Get the app

Before you can run the application, you need to get the application source code onto your machine.

Clone the [getting-started-app](https://github.com/docker/getting-started-app/tree/main) repository using the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/docker/getting-started-app.git
```

### Build the app's image

To build the image, you'll need to use a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is simply a text-based file with no file extension that contains a script of instructions. Docker uses this script to build a container image.

Create an empty file named `Dockerfile`:

```shell
touch Dockerfile
```

Using a text editor or code editor, add the following contents to the Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN yarn install --production
CMD ["node", "src/index.js"]
EXPOSE 3000
```

In the terminal, make sure you are in the `getting-started-app` directory where your Dockerfile is. Replace `/path/to/getting-started-app` with the path to your `getting-started-app` directory.

```shell
cd /path/to/getting-started-app
```

Then, build the image using the following command:

```shell
docker build -t getting-started .
```

The `docker build` command uses the Dockerfile to build a new image. You might have noticed that Docker downloaded a lot of "layers". This is because you instructed the builder that you wanted to start from the `node:18-alpine` image. But, since you didn't have that on your machine, Docker needed to download the image.

After Docker downloaded the image, the instructions from the Dockerfile copied in your application and used `yarn` to install your application's dependencies. The `CMD` directive specifies the default command to run when starting a container from this image.

Finally, the `-t` flag tags your image. Think of this as a human-readable name for the final image. Since you named the image `getting-started`, you can refer to that image when you run a container.

The `.` at the end of the `docker build` command tells Docker that it should look for the `Dockerfile` in the current directory.

### Start an app container

Now that you have an image, you can run the application in a container using the `docker run` command.

Run your container using the `docker run` command and specify the name of the image you just created:

```shell
docker run -dp 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 getting-started
```

The `-d` flag (short for `--detach`) runs the container in the background. The `-p` flag (short for `--publish`) creates a port mapping between the host and the container. The `-p` flag takes a string value in the format of `HOST:CONTAINER`, where `HOST` is the address on the host, and `CONTAINER` is the port on the container. The command publishes the container's port 3000 to `127.0.0.1:3000` (`localhost:3000`) on the host. Without the port mapping, you wouldn't be able to access the application from the host.

After a few seconds, open your web browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/). You should see your app.

[![To-do list empty](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FJrodafo/University/main/Cheat_sheets/Docker/Assets/To-do_list_empty.png)](http://localhost:3000/)

Add an item or two and see that it works as you expect. You can mark items as complete and remove them. Your frontend is successfully storing items in the backend.

At this point, you have a running to-do list manager with a few items.

If you take a quick look at your containers, you should see at least one container running that's using the `getting-started` image and on port `3000`. To see your containers, you can use the CLI or Docker Desktop's graphical interface.

## Update the application

In the following steps, you'll change the "empty text" when you don't have any to-do list items to "You have no to-do items yet! Add one above!"

In the `src/static/js/app.js` file, update line 56 to use the new empty text:

```
- <p className="text-center">No items yet! Add one above!</p>
+ <p className="text-center">You have no to-do items yet! Add one above!</p>
```

Build your updated version of the image, using the docker build command (Make sure you are in the `getting-started-app` directory):

```shell
docker build -t getting-started .
```

Start a new container using the updated code:

```shell
docker run -dp 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 getting-started
```

You probably saw an error like this:

```
docker: Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint laughing_burnell 
(bb242b2ca4d67eba76e79474fb36bb5125708ebdabd7f45c8eaf16caaabde9dd): Bind for 127.0.0.1:3000 failed: port is already allocated.
```

The error occurred because you are not able to start the new container while your old container is still running. The reason is that the old container is already using the host's port 3000 and only one process on the machine (containers included) can listen to a specific port. To fix this, you need to remove the old container.

### Remove the old container and image

To remove a container, you first need to stop it. Once it has stopped, you can remove it. You can remove the old container using the CLI or Docker Desktop's graphical interface. Choose the option that you are most comfortable with.

Get the ID of the container by using the `docker ps` or `docker ps -a` command.

```shell
docker ps
```

```shell
docker ps -a
```

Use the `docker stop` command to stop the container. Replace `<container-id>` with the ID from `docker ps`.

```shell
docker stop <container-id>
```

Once the container has stopped, you can remove it by using the `docker rm` command.

```shell
docker rm <container-id>
```

You can stop and remove a container in a single command by adding the `force` flag to the `docker rm` command:

```shell
docker rm -f <container-id>
```

Then, remove the `getting-started` image:

```shell
docker image rm <the-image-id>
```

### Build and start the updated app container

Now, build your updated version of the image, using the docker build command (Make sure you are in the `getting-started-app` directory):

```shell
docker build -t getting-started .
```

Then, start your updated app using the `docker run` command:

```shell
docker run -dp 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 getting-started
```

Refresh your browser on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) and you should see your updated help text.

Remember to stop the container when you stop using your application using the following command (This way we would free up port 3000 for use by other applications):

```shell
docker stop <container-id>
```

## Share the application

### Docker Hub

#### Create a repository

1. Sign up or Sign in to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).
2. Select the **Create Repository** button.
3. For the repository name, use `getting-started`. Make sure the **Visibility** is **Public**.
4. Select **Create**.

#### Push the image

1. Open your terminal and sign in to Docker Hub using the command `docker login -u YOUR-USER-NAME`.
2. Use the `docker tag` command to give the `getting-started` image a new name. Replace `YOUR-USER-NAME` with your Docker ID:
    ```shell
    docker tag getting-started YOUR-USER-NAME/getting-started
    ```
3. Now run the docker push command again. If you are copying the value from Docker Hub, you can drop the tagname part, as you didn't add a tag to the image name. If you don't specify a tag, Docker uses a tag called latest:
    ```shell
    docker push YOUR-USER-NAME/getting-started
    ```

#### Run the image on a new instance

Now that your image has been built and pushed into a registry, try running your app on a brand new instance that has never seen this container image. To do this, you will use Play with Docker.

1. Open your browser to [Play with Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/).
2. Select Login and then select docker from the drop-down list.
3. Sign in with your Docker Hub account and then select Start.
4. Select the ADD NEW INSTANCE option on the left side bar. If you don't see it, make your browser a little wider. After a few seconds, a terminal window opens in your browser.
5. In the terminal, start your freshly pushed app:
    ```shell
    docker run -dp 0.0.0.0:3000:3000 YOUR-USER-NAME/getting-started
    ```
6. Select the 3000 badge when it appears. If the 3000 badge doesn't appear, you can select **Open Port** and specify `3000`.

### GitHub Packages & Docker Hub

#### Login

1. Log in to **Docker Hub**:

    ```sh
    docker login
    ```
2. Log in to **GitHub Packages**:

    ```sh
    echo YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN | docker login ghcr.io -u YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME --password-stdin
    ```

#### Build & Tag

3. Build the Docker image:

    ```sh
    docker build -t fjrodafo/getting-started:v1.0.0 .
    ```
4. Tag the image for **Docker Hub**:

    ```sh
    docker tag fjrodafo/getting-started:v1.0.0 fjrodafo/getting-started:v1.0.0
    ```
5. Tag the image for **GitHub Packages**:

    ```sh
    docker tag fjrodafo/getting-started:v1.0.0 ghcr.io/fjrodafo/getting-started:v1.0.0
    ```

#### Push

6. Push the image to **Docker Hub**:

    ```sh
    docker push fjrodafo/getting-started:v1.0.0
    ```
7. Push the image to **GitHub Packages**:

    ```sh
    docker push ghcr.io/fjrodafo/getting-started:v1.0.0
    ```

#### Pull

8. Pull the image from **Docker Hub**:

    ```sh
    docker pull fjrodafo/getting-started:v1.0.0
    ```
9. Pull the image from **GitHub Packages**:

    ```sh
    docker pull ghcr.io/fjrodafo/getting-started:v1.0.0
    ```

## Persist the DB

### Container volumes

[Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) provide the ability to connect specific filesystem paths of the container back to the host machine. If you mount a directory in the container, changes in that directory are also seen on the host machine. If you mount that same directory across container restarts, you'd see the same files.

There are two main types of volumes. You'll eventually use both, but you'll start with volume mounts.

### Create a volume and start the container

1. Create a volume by using the `docker volume create` command:
    ```shell
    docker volume create to-do-db
    ```
2. Stop and remove the to-do app container with `docker rm -f <container-id>`, as it is still running without using the persistent volume.
3. Start the to-do app container, but add the `--mount` option to specify a volume mount. Give the volume a name, and mount it to `/etc/todos` in the container, which captures all files created at the path. In your Mac or Linux terminal, or in Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell, run the following command:
    ```shell
    docker run -dp 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 --mount type=volume,src=to-do-db,target=/etc/todos getting-started
    ```
    [![Items added](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FJrodafo/University/main/Cheat_sheets/Docker/Assets/Items_added.png)](http://localhost:3000/)
4. Stop and remove the container for the to-do app. Use Docker Desktop or `docker ps` to get the ID and then `docker rm -f <container-id>` to remove it.
5. Start a new container using the previous steps.
6. Open the app. You should see your items still in your list.
7. Go ahead and remove the container when you are done checking out your list.

You've now learned how to persist data.

### Dive into the volume

A lot of people frequently ask "Where is Docker storing my data when I use a volume?" If you want to know, you can use the `docker volume inspect` command.

```shell
docker volume inspect to-do-db
```

The `Mountpoint` is the actual location of the data on the disk. Note that on most machines, you will need to have root access to access this directory from the host.
