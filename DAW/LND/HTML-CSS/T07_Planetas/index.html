    <h2 id="mercury"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)">Mercury</a></h2>
    <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes
        87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury),
        god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god
        Hermes (Ἑρμῆς). Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and its apparent
        distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°. This proximity to the Sun means the planet can
        only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or the eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight.
        At this time, it may appear as a bright star-like object, but is more difficult to observe than Venus. From
        Earth, the planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, which
        recurs over its synodic period of approximately 116 days. The synodic proximity of Mercury to Earth makes
        Mercury most of the time Earth's closest planet, despite Venus at times approaching Earth closer than any other
        planet can.</p>

    <h2 id="venus"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_(planet)">Venus</a></h2>
    <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is sometimes called Earth's "sister" or "twin" planet as it is almost
        as large and has a similar composition. As an interior planet to Earth, Venus (like Mercury) appears in Earth's
        sky never far from the Sun, either as morning star or evening star. Aside from the Sun and Moon, Venus is the
        brightest natural object in Earth's sky, capable of casting visible shadows on Earth at dark conditions and
        being visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.</p>

    <h2 id="earth"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_(planet)">Earth</a></h2>
    <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. While large volumes
        of water can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water. About 71% of
        Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, and rivers. The remaining 29% of
        Earth's surface is land, consisting of continents and islands. Earth's surface layer is formed of several slowly
        moving tectonic plates, interacting to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth's liquid outer
        core generates the magnetic field that shapes Earth's magnetosphere, deflecting destructive solar winds. Earth's
        atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere like carbon dioxide (CO2)
        trap a part of the energy from the Sun close to the surface. Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere and
        forms clouds that cover most of the planet. More solar energy is received by tropical regions than polar regions
        and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation. A region's climate is governed by latitude, but also
        by elevation and proximity to moderating oceans. In most areas severe weather, such as tropical cyclones,
        thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs and greatly impacts life.</p>

    <h2 id="mars"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_(planet)">Mars</a></h2>
    <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than only
        Mercury. In the English language, Mars is named for the Roman god of war. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a
        thin atmosphere (less than 1% that of Earth's), and has a crust primarily composed of elements similar to
        Earth's crust, as well as a core made of iron and nickel. Mars has surface features such as impact craters,
        valleys, dunes, and polar ice caps. It has two small and irregularly shaped moons: Phobos and Deimos.</p>

    <h2 id="jupiter"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_(planet)">Jupiter</a></h2>
    <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more
        than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but slightly less than
        one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after
        the Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times. It was named after the Roman god Jupiter,
        the king of the gods. Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium constitutes one-quarter of its mass
        and one-tenth of its volume. It probably has a rocky core of heavier elements, but, like the other giant planets
        in the Solar System, it lacks a well-defined solid surface. The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's interior
        generates more heat than it receives from the Sun. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is an
        oblate spheroid: it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere is divided into a
        series of latitudinal bands, with turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result
        of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm which has been observed since at least 1831.</p>

    <br />
    <h2 id="saturn"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_(planet)">Saturn</a></h2>
    <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas
        giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth. It has only one-eighth the average
        density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive. Saturn's interior is
        most likely composed of a core of iron-nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). Its core is surrounded by
        a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally, a
        gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical
        current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which
        is weaker than Earth's, but which has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size.
        Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's. The outer atmosphere is generally bland
        and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 km/h
        (1,100 mph; 500 m/s), higher than on Jupiter but not as high as on Neptune. The planet's most notable feature is
        its prominent ring system, which is composed mainly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and
        dust. At least 83 moons are known to orbit Saturn, of which 53 are officially named; this does not include the
        hundreds of moonlets in its rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon and the second largest in the Solar System, is
        larger than the planet Mercury, although less massive, and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a
        substantial atmosphere.</p>

    <h2 id="uranus"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus_(planet)">Uranus</a></h2>
    <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the sky, Uranus (Caelus),
        who, according to Greek mythology, was the great-grandfather of Ares (Mars), grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and
        father of Cronus (Saturn). It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the
        Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ
        from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and
        Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the other giant planets. As with gas giants, ice giants also
        lack a well defined "solid surface." Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary
        composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with
        traces of other hydrocarbons. It has the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum
        temperature of 49 K (-224 °C; -371 °F), and has a complex, layered cloud structure with water thought to make up
        the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds. The interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices
        and rock.</p>

    <h2 id="neptune"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune_(planet)">Neptune</a></h2>
    <p>Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and the farthest known solar planet. In the Solar System, it is the
        fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times
        the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller
        than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. It is referred to
        as one of the solar system's two ice giant planets (the other one being Uranus). Being composed primarily of
        gases and liquids, it has no well-defined "solid surface". The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at
        an average distance of 30.1 AU (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion mi). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and
        has the astronomical symbol ♆, representing Neptune's trident.</p>
