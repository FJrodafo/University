    <definition>
        A
        <term>Turing Machine</term>
        refers to a finite automaton with infinite memory that can be proved equivalent to any other finite automaton with an arbitrary large amount of memory.
        So what is valid for a Turing Machine is valid for all Turing Machines regardless of how they are implemented.
